I was supposed to go shooting in the morning, but it is raining like crazy, so instead we have an indoor working day. I kind of like these days, sitting together in a small space, concentrating on work, because as soon as we finish, we can hang out. My mom told me to write down each day in a journal, because with years passing I will start to forget. `I did the same thing 10 years ago, when I was travelling in Asia with Tomasz, for a year I wrote each day, everything that has happened. Sometimes I go back to these journals (I wrote 3) and I read them like books, because I literally don’t remember that some of these things happened to me. A crazy experience. Thankfully, I have this blog and I can write as much as I want. So… I will write about yesterday. We woke up early in a morning to a beautiful sun. I was working and observing the sun rays dancing on a table. We parked next to Szczeci?ska Lagoon and there were many birds just meters away from us. It was one of these mornings when you love van life the most. We’ve decided to have breakfast outside, which maybe wasn’t the best idea due to a low temperature, but we did enjoy it anyway. We were sitting on the edge of marina, frying eggs and cutting veggies. We had some strong coffee and I made a breakfast wrap, which turned out beautifully. Just a few simple ingredients – eggs, onion, capsicum and avocado. You wrap it, heat it in a pan and it tastes like heaven. You may think it was because of the cold weather, but we fried some more in a van and it tasted as good as outside. Van kitchen is simple, mostly because there is no space for complicated. But this is also how breakfast should be – easy and delicious.", "imageUrl": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1493770348161-369560ae357d?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=750&q=80", "author": "John Doe" }, { "id": 2, "title": "Waking up early to the smell of coffee and French toast is, perhaps, the finest of all simple pleasures.", "body": "Dessert for breakfast? Yep! Some scientists think this can help you eat better the rest of the day, so we tried it out.Can this simple lifestyle hack curb snacking? I decided to find out. When you’re trying to eat right, the last thing on your meal plan is dessert, right? What if I told you that was all wrong? That dessert for breakfast is the new way to keep yourself full all day long and prevent excess snacking. I know it’s hard to believe, so I decided to give this dessert-first trend a try myself. Changing the way you eat is a huge move. However, there is some evidence to suggest that eating dessert for breakfast could help stave off hunger for a good part of the day. According to a study from the Endocrine Society, eating a 600-calorie high-carb breakfast including a small dessert such as a sweet cookie or chocolate could help to improve weight loss. The eight-month trial measured the results of two groups of participants: those who ate a low-carb breakfast and those who ate a high-carb meal instead. Both groups included a sweet dessert-like element in their meals. Those in the higher calorie and higher carb group were able to lose weight and keep it off, unlike the other participants.", "imageUrl": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1495214783159-3503fd1b572d?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&auto=format&fit=crop&w=750&q=80", "author": "Shreyas Patil" { "id": 10, "title": "Watermelons are superb in Summer", "body": "Watermelon is around 90% water, which makes it useful for staying hydrated in the summer. It can also satisfy a sweet tooth with its natural sugars. Watermelon also contains antioxidants. These substances can help remove molecules known as free radicals, or reactive species, from the body. The body produces free radicals during natural processes, such as metabolism. They can also develop through smoking, air pollution, stress, and other environmental pressures. If too many free radicals stay in the body, oxidative stress can occur. This can result in cell damage and may lead to a range of diseases, such as cancer and heart disease. The body can remove some free radicals naturally, but dietary antioxidants support this process.", "imageUrl": "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1502741282025-a9c6a20aa697?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=750&q=80", "author": "Fruity" } ]
